## Project: NC Cigar Sales Form Filler

### Today's Progress

#### Authentication System
- Successfully implemented user authentication system using Supabase
- Created and tested API endpoints:
  - Login (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`)
  - Registration (`POST /api/v1/auth/register`)
  - Token Refresh (`POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`)
  - User Profile (`GET /api/v1/users/me`)
- Fixed 401 authentication issues that were preventing admin login
- Created admin user account (admin3@example.com) with proper role permissions
- Implemented session persistence with refresh tokens

#### API Documentation
- Set up Swagger UI for API documentation at `/api/swagger`
- Created OpenAPI specification at `/api/docs`
- Enhanced Swagger UI with custom email/password authentication form
  - Added UI for direct login in Swagger interface
  - Implemented token storage in localStorage for persistent sessions
  - Added automatic token application to authenticated requests
- Configured multiple authentication schemes in the OpenAPI spec:
  - Bearer token (JWT)
  - API Key
  - OAuth2 Password flow

#### Database
- Established connection to Supabase database
- Set up initial database schema 
- Implemented user tables with role-based permissions

### Issues Resolved
- Fixed authentication token format issues (removed duplicate "Bearer" prefix)
- Resolved import errors related to service creation
- Fixed 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing protected endpoints

### Next Steps
- Implement remaining API endpoints for form management
- Create user identifier management endpoints
- Develop tax rate calculation functionality
- Build form entry and submission workflows

### Notes
- The application follows an API-first architecture as specified in the technical documentation
- Frontend development will begin once the core API endpoints are fully implemented and tested
