# Original Reference Documents

This directory contains the original, unmodified specification documents for the NC Cigar Sales Form Filler project. These files are kept for reference purposes, while the modular documentation in the parent directories is used for active development.

## Files

- **B-A-101 Schedule A.pdf** - Original NC Department of Revenue form template
- **requirements-improved.md** - Complete project requirements specification
- **technical-spec-improved.md** - Detailed technical specifications
- **ui-spec-improved.md** - Complete UI design and interaction specifications

## Usage Guidelines

1. These reference documents should NOT be modified
2. When making changes to specifications, update the appropriate files in the parent directories
3. If a discrepancy is found between these reference documents and the modular documentation, the reference documents should be considered authoritative
4. Use these files when you need comprehensive context on the entire system

## Document Maintenance

If the specifications are updated:

1. Update the modular documentation in the parent directories
2. Replace these reference documents with the new versions
3. Update this README if necessary

The modular documentation structure is designed to avoid needing to reference these full documents during normal development tasks.
